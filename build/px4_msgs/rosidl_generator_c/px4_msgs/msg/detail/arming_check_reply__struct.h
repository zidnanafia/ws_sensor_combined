/**
  * Arming check reply
  *
  * This is a response to an ArmingCheckRequest message sent by the FMU to an external component, such as a ROS 2 navigation mode.
  * The response contains the current set of external mode requirements, and a queue of events indicating recent failures to set the mode (which the FMU may then forward to a ground station).
  * The request is sent regularly to all registered ROS modes, even while armed, so that the FMU always knows and can forward the current state.
  *
  * Note that the external component is identified by its registration_id, which is allocated to the component during registration (arming_check_id in RegisterExtComponentReply).
  * The message is not used by internal/FMU components, as their mode requirements are known at compile time.
